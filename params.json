{"name":"Field Tools","body":"## Overview\r\n\r\nField Tools is an efficient, easy to use depth of field calculator for photographers working in the field. Using just a few touches, you can quickly calculate hyperfocal, near focus and far focus distances, all from a single screen. App settings are also a single touch away. Features include:\r\n\r\n* Large, easy to read result display\r\n* Switch distance type - hyperfocal, near limit, far limit and combined near/far limits - with a single touch\r\n* Sliders for adjusting focal length, aperture and focus distance\r\n* Configure multiple cameras and lenses and switch between them with just a few touches\r\n* Results in meters, feet or feet and inches\r\n\r\n## Source Code\r\n\r\nField Tools is implemented as a utility application. The settings \"side\" of the app uses UITableViews and UINavigationController to configure cameras and lenses. Hopefully, the source can serve as an example of a reasonably well written app that is a bit more substantial than the typical sample Cocoa Touch code.\r\n\r\nThe \"master\" branch contains source for versions that have been released to the iTunes App Store. To follow on-going development, have a look at the \"develop\" branch.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\nDownloads are available from the [iTunes App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=305817254&mt=8).\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\n\r\nWikipedia has several good articles on the theory of [depth of field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field) generally, and [hyperfocal distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocal_distance) specifically.\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n\r\nField Tools is licensed under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
